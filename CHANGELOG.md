* Added supporting documentation

## Legacy

The CodeQL Runner has been deprecated as of version 2.6.2 of the CodeQL CLI. All functionality is now natively available in the CodeQL CLI.

Please use the CodeQL CLI Bundle instead of the CodeQL Runner. To migrate, follow the [Migrating from the CodeQL Runner to the CodeQL CLI Bundle](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/code-scanning/using-codeql-code-scanning-with-your-existing-ci-system/migrating-from-the-codeql-runner-to-codeql-cli) guide.

The legacy template files for the CodeQL Runner can be found in the `_deprecated` folder.
