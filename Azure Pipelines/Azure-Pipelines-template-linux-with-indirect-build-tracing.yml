# This sample YAML file shows how to configure an Azure Pipeline to analyze a repository using the CodeQL CLI Bundle
# This example assumes a Linux environment and takes advantage of indirect build tracing ("sandwich mode") to leverage an existing set of build command

# Use this when a repository is stored in GitHub
# To run Codeql in azure repos see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/security/github-advanced-security-code-scanning?view=azure-devops

# The pipeline needs have a variable called GITHUB_TOKEN (don't forget to set it as secret)
# This secret will contain a personal access token. Either classic or fine grained (preferably)
# The Clasic token requires the following scopes: Repo
# The fine grained token requires the following permissions: Code scanning alerts (read and write)

# Adapt the trigger to your needs
trigger:
    branches:
      include:
      - '*'
    paths:
      exclude:
      - test/*
      - doc/*
      - lib/*
      include:

variables:
  # Language to scan. Possible values
  #   cpp, csharp, go, java, javascript, python, ruby, swift

        # OPTIONAL: Download CodeQL CLI Bundle
        # The CodeQL bundle (containing the CodeQL CLI as well as the pre-compiled CodeQL Query Suites, which is recommended for CI/CD integration) can either be download as part of the pipeline,
        # or pre-downloaded and placed on the CI/CD build machine(s). In this example, we download the latest CLI bundle (at time of writing) as part of the pipeline from
        # https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases, extract it and place it on the PATH.
