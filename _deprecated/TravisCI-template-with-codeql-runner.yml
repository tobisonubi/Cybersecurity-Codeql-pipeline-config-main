The CodeQL Runner has been deprecated as of version 2.6.2 of the CodeQL CLI.
All functionality is now natively available in the CodeQL CLI.
Please use the CodeQL CLI Bundle instead of the CodeQL Runner.

# This sample .travis.yml shows how to configure a TravisCI workflow to analyze a repository using the CodeQL Runner
# The example assumes a simple Java application built using Maven

# Assumes an existing GitHub Apps or personal access token: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token stored as pipeline variable GITHUB_TOKEN
# Currently this workflow runs on commit, you will need to setup triggers for workflow to run on certain branches, PR, scheduled, etc.

# GitHub Docs "Running CodeQL Runner in your CI system" - https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secure-coding/using-codeql-code-scanning-with-your-existing-ci-system/running-codeql-runner-in-your-ci-system 

language: java
jdk: 
  - oraclejdk15

arch: amd64
os: linux
dist: focal

branches:
  only:
  - main

install:
  - java --version
  - ./mvnw clean install
  - ./mvnw test

script:
  # STEP 1 (OPTIONAL): Download CodeQL Runner
  # The CodeQL Runner can either be download as part of the pipeline,
  # or pre-downloaded and placed on the CI/CD build machine(s). If pre-downloading, replace ./codeql-runner-linux in subsequent stages with the absolute path to the download location.
  - wget https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/latest/download/codeql-runner-linux
  - chmod +x codeql-runner-linux #Give CodeQL Runner executable access

  # STEP 2: Initialize the CodeQL Runner
  # Assumes an existing GitHub Apps or personal access token: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token stored as pipeline variable
  # Full documentation for init step: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/configuring-codeql-code-scanning-in-your-ci-system#init
  # In this example, the security-extended suite is used, which includes both security queries and code quality queries
  - echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | ./codeql-runner-linux init --repository org/repo --github-url https://github.com --queries security-extended --github-auth-stdin
  
  # STEP 3: Set BUILD step environment variables (only required for compiled languages)
  # Set the generated environment variables so they are available for subsequent commands
  # This script created as part of the ./codeql-runner-linux init step and referenced in init logs
  - . ${TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR}/codeql-runner/codeql-env.sh # REMOVE this step if you are not scanning any compiled languages (ex. Java) and only scanning scripting languages (ex. JavaScript)
  
  # STEP 4: Build codebase (only required for compiled languages)
  # Example 1: Use the AutoBuilder
  # The CodeQL Runner comes with a sopfisticated AutoBuilder, which attempts to build the code based on files in the repository
  # Full documentation for autobuild step: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/configuring-codeql-code-scanning-in-your-ci-system#autobuild
  - ./codeql-runner-linux autobuild --language java # REMOVE this step if you are not scanning any compiled languages (ex. Java) and only scanning scripting languages (ex. JavaScript)
  # Example 2: Providing manual build command
  # Alternatively, we can run the build command to compile the code. In this example, we have a simple maven project with a pom.xml in the root of the repository, and a settings file in a subdirectory
  # For Code Scanning purposes, we only need to compile the code. As such, we disable executing our test suite. This can be changed according to your needs      
  # command: 'mvn clean install -DskipTests=true -s settings/settings.xml'   

  # STEP 5: Analyze CodeQL database and send results to GitHub 
  # Analyze the snapshot database created as part of the build, by running the selected queries against it
  # Assumes an existing GitHub Apps or personal access token: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
  # Full documentation for analyze step: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/configuring-codeql-code-scanning-in-your-ci-system#analyze
  # Once the analysis is done, the results will be uploaded to GitHub
  # Specifying the --ram attribute puts a ceiling on memory resources used by CodeQL runner, use this if you experience errors where CodeQL runner runs out of memory resources
  - echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | ./codeql-runner-linux analyze --repository org/repo --github-url https://github.com --commit $TRAVIS_COMMIT --ref refs/heads/main --github-auth-stdin
